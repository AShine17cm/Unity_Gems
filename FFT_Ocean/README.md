# FFT-Ocean
Fast Fourier Transform ocean waves simulation for Unity. This is a prototype. Not recommended for real projects.

There is a newer version available at https://github.com/gasgiant/Ocean-URP. It features a much more performant simulation, geomorphing, better ocean shader, underwater effect and more. However it is unfinished. I haven't had time to work on it for a while, so I decided to make it open.
